This repository contains the implementation of the Response Generator system, which generates responses for non-sensitive emails using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The RAG system retrieves relevant information from specific documents and websites to construct accurate and helpful replies.

## Features

- **Automated Response Generation**: Generates responses for non-sensitive emails using the RAG system.
- **Integration with Categorizer**: Receives non-sensitive emails from the Email Categorizer system for processing.
- **Information Retrieval**: Utilizes specific documents and websites to gather relevant information for responses.

## Objectives

- Improve response efficiency by automating replies to non-sensitive emails.
- Ensure responses are accurate and contextually relevant by leveraging the RAG system.
- Maintain a high standard of data privacy and user consent.
