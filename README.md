# Email Categorizer

This repository contains the implementation of the Email Categorization system, which classifies incoming emails into sensitive and non-sensitive categories. Sensitive emails are directed to staff for manual handling, while non-sensitive emails are processed further by the Response Generator system.

## Features

- **Email Classification**: Automatically categorizes emails into sensitive and non-sensitive categories.
- **API Integration**: Exposes API endpoints for communication with the Response Generator system.
- **Focus on Privacy**: Ensures data privacy and consent by handling sensitive emails manually.

## Objectives

- Enhance efficiency by automating the classification of emails.
- Maintain data privacy and consent by managing sensitive emails with human oversight.
- Facilitate seamless integration with the Response Generator system for non-sensitive emails.
