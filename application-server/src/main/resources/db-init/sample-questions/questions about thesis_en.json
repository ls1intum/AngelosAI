  "question" : "Do I need to do anything for thesis registration, does the 4 months begin directly after registering or later, and when must my thesis be finished if I want to start my Master's in summer semester?\"",
  "answer" : "Your supervisor will handle the thesis registration, and you'll need to confirm the data by email. The 4-month timeline starts on the date entered by your supervisor in the CIT portal, and the thesis should ideally be finished and graded by the end of the winter semester to start the Master's in summer.",
