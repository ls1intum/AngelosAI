  "question" : "Hello, I am planning modules for the coming semester and still need 7 ECTS for elective modules. There is no lecture with 7 ECTS and it is difficult to find two lectures with 6+1 or 5+2 ECTS. What happens if I take two modules with 5 ECTS each and thus have a surplus of 3 ECTS? Is that a problem? How does that affect the final grade? Can modules be partially credited? Can I choose which modules are weighted and how?\"",
  "answer" : "If you take two modules of 5 ECTS each and have a surplus of 3 ECTS, this is not a problem. Your studies will then be completed with 183 ECTS and the final grade will be calculated using the divisor 183 if you are a Bachelor student. Best regards.",
