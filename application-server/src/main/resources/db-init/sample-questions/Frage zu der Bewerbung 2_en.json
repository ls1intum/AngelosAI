  "question" : "I am a student studying B.Sc. Physics and I want to change my field of study to Computer Science. I have registered two subjects without any prerequisites and would like to know if I can start directly in the summer semester of 2025 with sufficient grades in IN0004 and IN0001. I am also interested in whether I will then have to pay the tuition fee of 3000 euros. I am also having difficulties registering for other subjects and wanted to clarify whether I missed the registration period and what steps I should take.",
  "answer" : "To be accepted into the Bachelor of Computer Science in the summer semester, you need at least 30 credits that can be credited. The subjects IN0004 and IN0001 alone are not sufficient for this. For information on tuition fees, please consult the website on tuition fees for students from non-EU countries. If you have difficulty registering, please contact the relevant lecturers directly, as we cannot help with registration.",
