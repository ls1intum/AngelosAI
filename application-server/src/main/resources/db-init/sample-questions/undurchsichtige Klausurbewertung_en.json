  "question" : "Dear Student Advisor, I have noticed that my performance in the Robot Motion Planning exam was unfairly assessed compared to other students. I have already spoken to my lecturer about this, but without a satisfactory answer. What further steps can I take? Thank you for your support.\"",
  "answer" : "I'm sorry that there were discrepancies. Since you have already spoken to the examiner, your last option is to appeal against the semester notice when it arrives in November. The legal remedies are explained in the notice. Good luck!",
