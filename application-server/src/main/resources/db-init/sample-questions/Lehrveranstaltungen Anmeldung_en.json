  "question" : "Hello, I would like to register for various courses. I have already been able to register for one course, but the other courses do not have a registration process. Some redirect to a Moodle page that I do not have access to. How can I register for these courses?",
  "answer" : "Hello, if you are unable to register for the course, that is not a problem. You can still attend the lectures. However, make sure that you register for the exams later, as it is not possible to take the exams without registering.",
