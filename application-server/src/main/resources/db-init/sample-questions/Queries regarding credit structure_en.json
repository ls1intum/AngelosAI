  "question" : "I am currently in my Master's program and want to confirm the requirements regarding the completion of areas for my degree. Do I need to complete three areas (major and two minors), or is it sufficient to complete credits under elective modules instead? Additionally, I have completed my major and one minor but have extra creditsâ€”do those count towards the electives? Is this requirement still current?\"",
  "answer" : "Yes, you still need 18 ECTS for your major and two supplementary areas of 8 ECTS each. The extra credits from your minor can count towards the electives. It appears you are referencing an outdated structure; please refer to the current requirements on our website: https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-informatics/curriculum/. I hope this helps!",
