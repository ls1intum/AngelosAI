  "question" : "I submitted my bachelor's thesis on Sunday and unfortunately discovered a typo in the title on the cover page. The title is registered correctly in Koinon. I have already sent a message to a contact person, but have not received a response yet. What should I do now and who should I contact?",
  "answer" : "Your request has been received and the responsible department will contact you. As a rule, the title for the certificate is not taken from the cover page, but from TUMonline. If the title there is correct, there is no need to worry.",
