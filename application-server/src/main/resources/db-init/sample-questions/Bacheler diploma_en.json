  "question" : "I have just graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and will start my Master's soon. I would like to know if my grades can be entered this week, and how I can obtain a confirmation document that I have completed all 180 credits for my degree as quickly as possible.",
  "answer" : "If you are starting your Master's program, the service office will inform the admission office that you successfully finished your Bachelor's studies, so you do not need a confirmation document. For more information, refer to this link: https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studierende/abschlussarbeit-abschluss/informatik/ --> Ãœbergang Bachelor zu Master. If enrolling at another university, contact the secretary of the examination board for confirmation.",
