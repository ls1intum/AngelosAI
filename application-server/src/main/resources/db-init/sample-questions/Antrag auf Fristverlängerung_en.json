  "topic" : "Application for an extension for ECTS points",
  "question" : "Dear Sir or Madam, I would like to apply for an extension to achieve the required ECTS points in my bachelor's degree in computer science. I have not achieved the minimum number of 90 ECTS by 2 ECTS due to exceptional circumstances. During the sixth semester, I was busy with several demanding courses and a new student job. In addition, I had to move due to an unexpected eviction and the internship partner was unreliable. These factors led to an illness that affected my performance. I am requesting an extension to acquire the remaining 2 ECTS and to be able to continue my bachelor's degree. You will find all the relevant documents for the application enclosed.\"",
  "answer" : "To apply for an extension, a detailed certificate is required that contains information on the duration of the illness, its impact on studies, and a prognosis of performance in the next semester. In addition, a study plan is required that includes not only the previous semesters, but also a plan for completing the bachelor's degree program. Please send a new version of the plan.",
