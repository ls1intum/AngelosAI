  "topic" : "Topic: Switching from Business Informatics to Computer Science",
  "question" : "I am currently studying business informatics and have already completed my second bachelor's semester. I have doubts as to whether business informatics is the right course for me and whether I should switch to computer science. I would like to find out to what extent the module plan is useful for me and need information on the recognition of modules, the impact on my planned semester abroad and further study planning. I would be happy to have a personal consultation appointment (preferably as a video call).\"",
  "answer" : "Please always use a TUM email account for your inquiries. On our websites you will find examples of study plans for both computer science and business informatics, including the respective modules. Some modules are anchored in both degree programs, so that if you switch within the first year you can apply for recognition. A semester abroad is also possible after a change. You can visit us during office hours, but expect to wait.",
