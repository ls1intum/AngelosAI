  "question" : "I am about to graduate, but I will not reach the 150 ECTS by the end of the summer semester. How long can I continue to study? What regulations apply to me due to the \"Corona extension\"? I am afraid of losing my degree.\"",
  "answer" : "You are currently in your 8th semester and are benefiting from 3 flat-rate Corona deadline extensions. You must achieve 90 ECTS by the end of the summer semester, which you have already achieved with your 133 ECTS. After the next winter semester, you will need 120 ECTS and then 150 ECTS by the summer semester of 2025. If you complete your bachelor's thesis by then, you will achieve the required ECTS.",
