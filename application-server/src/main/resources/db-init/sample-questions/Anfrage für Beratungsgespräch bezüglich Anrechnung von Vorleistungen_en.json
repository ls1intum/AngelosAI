  "question" : "I am starting the first semester of the Master's program \"Information Systems\" at TUM and would like to have my previous achievements of around 32-47 credits recognized. I need a consultation for this because I have questions about recognition. I am not currently in Germany, so an online appointment would be ideal.\"",
  "answer" : "You can find all information about the recognition process on the following website: https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studierende/pruefungsangelegenheiten-module/informatik/anerkennungen/. There you will also find contact details for an open recognition consultation hour that you can use if you have any questions. A dedicated consultation appointment is not necessary.",
