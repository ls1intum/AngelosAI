  "question" : "I have earned degrees in computer science over the past 8 years and am considering applying to teach at Bavarian high schools. However, I was rejected because I have to have both a bachelor's and a master's degree from a university. I am wondering if I can get credits transferred to TU Munich, as I have collected over 330 credits that are equivalent to many of the computer science courses at TU Munich. Could you give me a rough estimate of how many credits could be transferred, or if you know of any similar cases?\"",
