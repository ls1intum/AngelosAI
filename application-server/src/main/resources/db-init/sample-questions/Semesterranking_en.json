  "question" : "I have a question regarding the semester ranking due to my semester abroad. After completing my semester abroad, will I be able to top up my ranking with 30 credits grade 4.0, or will I only be compared with the regular number of credits from the first four semesters because I am on leave?\"",
  "answer" : "Since you are in your 4th semester in the winter semester, only the usual credits are required up to this point, i.e. 120. Missing credits are calculated as 4.1. You will receive the ranking including the winter semester in May at the earliest. You can find more information here: https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studierende/beratung/informatik/tipps.",
