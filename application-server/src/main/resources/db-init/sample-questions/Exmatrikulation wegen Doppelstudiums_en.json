  "question" : "I studied computer science for two semesters and would like to know if I have to manually deregister from computer science because I have chosen Management & Technology. My semester fee has already been debited for computer science; will this be registered for my new course of study when I deregister or is any action required?\"",
  "answer" : "The tuition fee is counted per person. If you have paid it for the winter semester, that is sufficient, even if you are no longer studying computer science. You can request to de-register or remain enrolled for the semester. In both cases, you will receive a notice stating that you have definitively failed the course.",
