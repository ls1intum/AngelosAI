  "question" : "I am registering for modules for the coming semester. What happens to excess credits? Can I choose a module that has more credits than required? Do the credits expire if I complete additional modules, or can I choose which ones are credited?\"",
  "answer" : "You can take modules that have more credits than you need. You will then finish your studies with more than the required credits. You can choose which modules count towards your final grade and which are just elective subjects.",
