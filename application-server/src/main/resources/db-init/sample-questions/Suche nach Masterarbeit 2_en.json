  "question" : "I've been struggling to find a topic for my master's thesis for a month now and haven't received any positive feedback yet. However, I have to write my thesis this semester. Is there a process for getting a topic assigned?",
  "answer" : "If you have applied with a CV, proof of achievement and cover letter and have received at least 5 rejections, you can be assigned a topic. However, this option should be the last resort, as you have no influence on the topic. If you still want to be assigned, please send the rejections together with your CV and proof of achievement by email.",
