  "question" : "I am currently enrolled in the first semester of my Computer Science Master's. I would like to switch to Data Engineering and Analytics next semester. Which valid electives can I choose in Computer Science and Data Engineering at the same time? Which Computer Science subjects can be recognized? Can I have Data Engineering subjects recognized as elective modules without being assigned to a subject area?\"",
  "answer" : "To find out which subjects overlap between computer science and data engineering, you need to look at the respective curriculum. If the module numbers of courses are identical, they can be recognized. If the module numbers are different, it will be checked individually whether recognition is possible.",
