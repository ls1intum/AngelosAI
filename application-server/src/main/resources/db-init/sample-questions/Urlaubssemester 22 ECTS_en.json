  "question" : "I am currently on a semester abroad and have questions about the recognition of ECTS. I have been approved for a semester off with 22 ECTS. Is it possible to \"cut off\" the 0.5 ECTS so that I can have 3 courses with 7 ECTS each (21 ECTS in total) recognized? Am I allowed to take repeat exams during the semester off that do not count towards the 22 ECTS?\"",
  "answer" : "You cannot delete the 0.5 ECTS and should ensure that the total of examinations at the host university and repeat examinations at TUM is kept below or at 29 ECTS in order to avoid being upgraded. The ECTS from the repeat examinations count towards the 29 ECTS.",
