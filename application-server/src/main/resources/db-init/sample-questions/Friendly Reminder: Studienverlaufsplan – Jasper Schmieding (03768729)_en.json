  "question" : "Hello,\n\nThank you for the information. I hope you are well.\n\nAt the time of the screenshot, an exam for three credits had not yet been accepted as \"valid\". 69 credits are now recorded in TUMonline. I do not plan to take a leave of absence to write the Advanced Topics of SE exam in the winter semester 2024/25. I have the following questions regarding the recognition of courses from abroad:\n\n1. Is a successful pre-check (recognition possible) and a successful check of equivalence with a TUM module (1:1 credit) sufficient to ensure successful and smooth recognition?\n\n2. Can you confirm that if I submit the recognition application in January or February (as soon as I have all the documents such as certificates together), the credits will count for the winter semester 2024/25?\n\nThank you again for your support - very valuable for my current plans.\n\nBest regards.\"",
  "answer" : "Good day,\n\nPlease contact my colleagues from the recognition team regarding the two questions on recognition.\n\nBest regards.",
