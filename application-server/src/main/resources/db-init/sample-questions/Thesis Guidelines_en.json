  "question" : "I’m currently in my 6th semester of my Master’s program and I need 6 months to finish my thesis, which will extend beyond my 6th semester. Will this cause a problem for my enrollment status, and can I have an additional semester to complete it?\"",
  "answer" : "If you have at least 90 ECTS after your 5th semester, you automatically receive an additional 7th semester to complete your Master’s degree, as outlined in the academic progress guidelines. You can finish your degree in the 7th semester as long as you meet this credit requirement.",
