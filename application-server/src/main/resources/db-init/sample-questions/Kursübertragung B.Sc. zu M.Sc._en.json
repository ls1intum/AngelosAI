  "question" : "Good afternoon,\n\nI have questions about the transition from B.Sc. Computer Science to M.Sc. Computer Science. I was officially enrolled in the Master's program and chose my courses via TUM Online, but with a Bachelor's registration. Do I have to choose my courses again for the Master's program? Will I lose my B.Sc. registrations if I am exmatriculated? When will I be exmatriculated? What happens to Moodle courses in which I have submitted assignments? And what about courses with fixed places that have already been allocated?\"",
  "answer" : "You will not be exmatriculated from the Bachelor's program until the end of the semester. This means that you can continue to be registered for the Bachelor's program. When registering for exams, you should register in the curriculum context of your Master's program so that the modules can be assigned correctly.",
