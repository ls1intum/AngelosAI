  "topic" : "Topic: Thesis in the Master's program",
  "question" : "I'm studying computer science for my master's degree and have been looking for a topic for my thesis for over a month. I've written several applications, but unfortunately I've only received rejections or no response. How can I make sure that I can find my thesis topic this semester? Are there mechanisms for students in this situation?\"",
  "answer" : "Finding a thesis can be difficult. We regularly offer events on this topic that have been recorded. Review your applications, add your CV, module overview and a letter of motivation. CC the professor and secretary and follow up after a few days. Also check the chair pages for open topics and remember to ask for an appointment in person as well. It is rare that someone cannot find a suitable topic, but in the event that nothing is found, we might assign a topic, albeit with less influence on the topic choice on your part and a longer process.",
