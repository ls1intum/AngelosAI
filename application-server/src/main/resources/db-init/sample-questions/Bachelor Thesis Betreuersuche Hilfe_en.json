  "question" : "I urgently need help finding a bachelor's thesis. I have sent many emails, but have received few responses and only a few topics are advertised. What can I do, as I have the feeling that there are hardly any supervisors for bachelor's theses?",
  "answer" : "Sometimes it is difficult to find a thesis. There are events on this topic that are recorded in a Moodle course. Check the application documents, add your CV, module overview and letter of motivation. Put the professor and the secretary in cc and follow up for a few days. Look for advertised topics on the department pages and ask for personal appointments. Sometimes it is helpful to ask professors from other faculties about topics. It is rare that someone cannot find a suitable topic, but an assignment by us could mean that the topics are not in your area of ​​interest.",
