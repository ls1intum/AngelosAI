  "question" : "Hello, I have a question regarding the credit hurdles in the Bachelor of Computer Science. I am currently in my 3rd semester and am unsure whether an application for recognition of academic achievements will be accepted, which could lead to a conflict with the credit hurdles. Could I de-register after the enrollment period without fear of failing, or even de-register in March if I don't have enough credits? Thank you very much for your help.\"",
