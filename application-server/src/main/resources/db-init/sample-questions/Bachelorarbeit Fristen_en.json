  "question" : "I have a question about the deadlines for my bachelor's thesis and the application for the master's program. I am writing my bachelor's thesis externally and would have started on December 1st, 2024, while the application deadline for the master's program ends on November 30th, 2024. Can I receive a document confirming that I am writing the thesis before starting the bachelor's thesis? Also, do I have to use the entire 5 months for the bachelor's thesis or can I submit it earlier? Is it possible for me to submit the thesis after the start of the master's semester? Could you help me with this, perhaps in a short Zoom meeting?\"",
  "answer" : "To apply, you only need the email that you receive from the portal as soon as the department registers your bachelor's thesis. This can be done before the first official processing day. You can also submit your bachelor's thesis before the deadline.",
