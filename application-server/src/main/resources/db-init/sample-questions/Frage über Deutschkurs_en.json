  "question" : "I am studying for my Master's in Computer Science at TUM and also completed my Bachelor's degree there. I am unsure whether my registered German course B1.1 + B1.2 counts as one of the interdisciplinary modules basics, as I read the information on the TUM website that this only applies if you do not have a Bachelor's degree in German. I have also already taken Japanese A1.1 + A1.2 and passed the exam. Can I get ECTS for another visit and passing the exam?\n\nBest regards\"",
  "answer" : "Since you completed your bachelor's degree in German at TUM, the German course does not count as one of the interdisciplinary modules for you. You should be able to receive ECTS for passing the exam in the Japanese course, but we recommend choosing modules in which you learn new content.\n\nBest regards",
