  "question" : "I am studying Game Engineering in my 3rd semester and I studied Japanese A1.1+A1.2 in my 1st semester. I thought this course did not count towards my total credits, but I found out that it could be credited retroactively as a language course. Is it possible to have the 6 credits for this course credited retroactively?\"",
