  "question" : "Hello, can a bachelor's thesis written in Computer Science B.Sc be recognized in Business Informatics? I plan to write my bachelor's thesis in a specific area. If I switch to Business Informatics in the summer semester, will I have to write another bachelor's thesis? And that will probably be in the same department.\"",
  "answer" : "A thesis is always for the degree you want to achieve. This means that a thesis cannot be recognized for another degree program. Why do you want to change degree programs if you have already written the thesis?",
  "study_program" : "bachelor-informatik"
