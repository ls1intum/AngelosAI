  "topic" : "extension of the deadline for studies",
  "question" : "I would like to request an extension again, as my arm injury last summer semester has severely affected my efficiency in my studies. I request that my application be reviewed and have attached all relevant documents.\"",
  "answer" : "The current summer semester is your 6th semester and you have already achieved 100 ECTS, which means that you are still within the deadline and cannot apply for an extension. It would be a good idea to take the repeat exams and perhaps make an appointment at a consultation hour to talk about your situation.",
