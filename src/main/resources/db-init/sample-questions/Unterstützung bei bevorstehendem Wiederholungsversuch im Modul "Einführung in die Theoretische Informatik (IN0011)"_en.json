  "question" : "Hello, thank you very much for your support and your time. I am enclosing my application for compensation so that my health restrictions can be taken into account in the upcoming exam in the \"Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science\" module. I would be very grateful if you could confirm whether this is my last attempt to successfully complete the module or whether there are other options if I do not pass the retake exam.\"",
  "answer" : "Hello, according to your documents you are in the 12th semester and have 5 extensions. You must demonstrate the study progress of the 7th semester. If you have 150 ECTS after the 7th semester (7 + 5 = 12th semester), you can study for a total of 9 semesters (9 + 5 = 14 semesters) and would therefore also have the next summer semester to pass the module. I assume that you have registered for the repeat exam. In the event that you fail again, you should do something to make sure it works next year. We can talk about compensation for disadvantages after the repeat exams. Good luck with the repeat exam!",
