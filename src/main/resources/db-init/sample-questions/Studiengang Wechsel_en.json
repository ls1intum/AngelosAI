  "question" : "Hello, dear TUM student advisors. I am an enrolled computer science student who would start next winter semester. I have realized that I would prefer to study business informatics. Since I have not yet registered for any courses, I wanted to ask whether it would be possible for me to start the business informatics course next semester. If this is not possible, I would like to discuss with you how best to change courses. I would like to make a personal appointment for a consultation. If you have one free in Garching today, that would be perfect, as I am currently here for the tutorial.\"",
  "answer" : "Hello, you are welcome to come to one of our open consultation hours without prior appointment: cit.tum.de/cit/studienfachberatung-informatik",
  "study_program" : "bachelor-wirtschaftsinformatik"
