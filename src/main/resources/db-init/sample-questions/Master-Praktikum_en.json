  "question" : "Hello, I have a quick question about the Master's internships. Unfortunately, I have to cancel my internship this semester. According to other students, you can only do a Master's internship in computer science once after you cancel with a grade of 5.0. However, I couldn't find any information about this in the FPSO. Can you help me with this? Thank you in advance and best regards,\"",
  "answer" : "Hello, this rule does not exist. Nevertheless, you should think carefully about which internships you apply for and when, so that you can actually take them up next time. Kind regards",
