  "topic" : "Modules in the Bachelor and Master in lectures that exclude each other",
  "question" : "I know the rule that you cannot include modules that you have taken in your bachelor's degree in your master's degree. How does this work with lectures that exclude each other, e.g. in the machine learning bucket? I took a lecture in my bachelor's degree and included it. Now I want to include another lecture in my master's degree that excludes each other. Is it possible to include the lecture in my master's degree even though I have already included the first one in my bachelor's degree?\"",
  "answer" : "Since Bachelor and Master are two different courses of study, it is easily possible to include the lecture in the Master as Data Analytics 1 out of 4.",
