  "question" : "I have been accepted for an internship and would like to apply for a semester off for the coming semester. Is it possible to take exams for modules that I have not passed in the past during a semester off, especially the retake exam for a specific module?\"",
  "answer" : "You can submit your application for a semester off until the first day of lectures. You will need a statement from the academic advisor and should send the relevant documents. During the semester off, you can only repeat exams that you previously failed. Have you already taken the retake exam this semester and which subjects are you planning to take in the winter semester?",
