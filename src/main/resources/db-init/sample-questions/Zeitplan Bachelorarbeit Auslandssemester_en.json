  "topic" : "Subject: Request for study progress control and bachelor thesis",
  "question" : "I would like to ask about a time estimate for the coming semester and about the study progress check. I also have questions about my bachelor's thesis and the requirements for it, as well as about the enrollment modalities for the master's. I have already found a supervisor for my bachelor's thesis and am planning to study abroad for a semester. I am concerned about possible delays in submitting my thesis and the study progress check, especially with regard to the required credits. I would also like to know whether I can register for the master's after successfully submitting the bachelor's thesis and whether I could then be enrolled in the bachelor's and master's programs at the same time. I would also like to know whether there are any advantages to registering for the master's before or after the semester abroad.\"",
  "answer" : "You must complete the study progress check at the end of the summer semester, which means you must have 90 ECTS. The bachelor's thesis can be registered at any time now, submission is via the CIT portal, not in Garching. You should register the thesis as soon as the scope is determined. It is necessary that you pass 'Theoretical Computer Science' to receive your degree. The clinical application project must be completed by the end of the 12th semester. To enroll in the master's degree, you need a completed bachelor's degree. If you expect to complete your studies, you can apply for the master's degree and must submit all documents before the deadline. It would be advisable to take a leave of absence for a semester abroad. If you have any further questions, please feel free to visit a consultation hour.",
