  "question" : "I'm entering my 7th semester and would like information about the bridging courses for the Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence master's program, as I want to take these in my bachelor's degree. The website says that the courses are listed in the acceptance letter, which I will only receive after applying. Is there a way to get this list in advance?\"",
  "answer" : "I think your plan to take a lot of modules in your bachelor's degree makes sense. Information on the modules required for the master's degree can be found in Appendix 2 of the FPSO for the degree program, which you can view here: https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/master-robotics-cognition-intelligence/ under the section Examinations and Regulations. The Application and Admissions section is also of interest to you.",
