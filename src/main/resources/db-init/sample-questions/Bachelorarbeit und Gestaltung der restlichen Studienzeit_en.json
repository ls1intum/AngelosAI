  "question" : "I am in the 6th semester of the business informatics course and plan to write my bachelor's thesis in the 7th semester. What requirements do I have to meet? Is it possible to write the thesis in collaboration with a company and what steps are necessary? I would also like information on how to structure my last semester, in particular recommended courses or projects to prepare for the bachelor's thesis and the transition to working life. I already have 112 ECTS and will reach over 120 ECTS. Should I look for positions at professorships now or wait until I am sure I have over 120 ECTS? I have sent many inquiries but have only received rejections. What options do I have if all the professorships reject me? Should I then study for another semester? How does the process of assigning topics work?\"",
  "answer" : "You can write your bachelor's thesis in the 7th semester if you meet the credit hurdles. There are no other special regulations. We offer an information event on the topic of thesis that can help you. When looking for a supervisor for your bachelor's thesis, it is important to prepare your applications well, including your CV, overview of the relevant modules and letter of motivation. If you have received at least 5 rejections, we can assign you a topic, although this assignment should be the last option, as you have no influence on the assigned topic. If you have any further questions about your application and the topic assignment, I will be happy to help you.",
