  "topic" : "Topic: Support in finding a topic for the bachelor thesis",
  "question" : "I am an Information Systems student and need help finding a topic for my bachelor's thesis. I have already contacted several departments, but have not received any positive feedback.\"",
  "answer" : "Finding a thesis can be challenging. We offer an annual event on this topic, the recording of which you can find in our Moodle course. Review the application documents, add a CV as well as relevant modules and a letter of motivation. CC the professor and the secretary and follow up after a few days. Also check the department pages for advertised topics and consider personal contacts with the departments, especially former professors of electrical engineering. If necessary, we can assign you a topic, but without any influence on your part.",
