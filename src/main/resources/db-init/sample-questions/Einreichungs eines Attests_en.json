  "topic" : "taking the exam while ill",
  "question" : "I have an exam today but I feel ill and am unsure whether I should attend. I have a medical certificate but I am worried about the ECTS hurdles and that I might get into trouble without the exam. If I go to the exam despite being ill, the medical certificate will be ineffective and I could fail the exam and not have a medical certificate available. What should I do?",
  "answer" : "If you go to the exam despite the medical certificate, the medical certificate will be ineffective because you are confirming that you feel healthy. To extend the credit hurdles, you need a reason that was not your fault. Illness on the day of the exam is not normally considered a sufficient reason. I recommend that you come to one of our open consultation hours: cit.tum.de/cit/studienfachberatung-informatik.",
