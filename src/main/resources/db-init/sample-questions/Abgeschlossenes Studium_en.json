  "question" : "Hello, I have completed my Master's in Computer Science and expected to be exmatriculated on October 1st. However, I am still officially enrolled because I have not yet received my certificate. I have registered as unemployed and am unsure whether I am enrolled until the end of the winter semester or whether I can be exmatriculated at any time.",
  "answer" : "You are enrolled until March 31, 2025, as long as you have not yet received your certificate. You can submit an application for de-registration via your TUMonline account. You should ask there directly whether retroactive de-registration as of October 1, 2024 is possible.",
