  "topic" : "Topic: Clarification of credit transfer in the elective module",
  "question" : "I am studying business informatics in my ninth semester and asked today in office hours about the transfer of credits for my elective module. I already have 8 credits and would like to take modules with a total of 11 credits this semester. Does the total number of credits count towards achieving 120 credits or only the remaining credits? Another student received a contrary statement. Could you give me a definitive answer to that?\"",
  "answer" : "No credits are cut off, but rather the entire modules always count. You need the 5 ECTS and the 6 ECTS to fill the elective modules with 15 ECTS. Therefore, you will complete your bachelor's degree with 184 ECTS.",
