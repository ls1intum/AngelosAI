  "question" : "I have questions about registering for compulsory modules and the exam requirement. I don't know how many dates I should select and why the campus system says that no one has registered for certain events yet. Do I only have to pass two compulsory module exams to be admitted to the next semester?\"",
  "answer" : "You must pass at least two of four foundation exams to meet the requirements. The more you pass, the better. Attend the first lecture and the foundation programming lab to get information on registering for tutoring exercises.",
