  "question" : "As part of my study planning, a question about module registration came up: Are there negative consequences if I take a module without registering for the corresponding exam? I intend to take two elective modules in the field of computer science this semester, but probably without registering for the corresponding exams. However, I am considering taking these elective modules again at a later date and then registering for the exams.\"",
  "answer" : "There are no consequences if you register for a module but not for the corresponding exam. This is no problem.",
