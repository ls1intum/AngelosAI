  "question" : "I would like to discuss transferring my bonus points to the retake exam for the EIST course. I was unable to attend the Endterm exam due to illness and have a doctor's note to confirm this. Despite reaching out to the relevant parties a month ago, I have not received a response. Can you assist me with this request?\"",
  "answer" : "You can use the earned bonus points for the retake exam since you were ill during the original exam. However, this decision must be made by the relevant examiner, so I recommend you contact them again.",
