  "question" : "I have questions about starting my Master's degree. Do I have to make a payment even though I haven't completed my Bachelor's degree yet? Is it possible to continue to be enrolled in my Bachelor's degree, and could this conflict with my Master's application? In addition, if I take the retake exam at the beginning of October, can I start my Master's degree directly in the winter semester? How long does it take for the Bachelor's certificate to be issued, and is it sufficient if I submit the application for enrollment while I wait for the certificate?\"",
  "answer" : "You should re-register for the Bachelor's degree program in order to remain enrolled until the end of the semester. It is possible to take Master's modules while you are enrolled in the Bachelor's program. If the Bachelor's certificate is issued in time, it can be reported directly to the Enrollment Office so that you can continue with enrollment. Otherwise, you can re-apply for the summer semester while continuing to attend the Master's modules. However, you must separately request confirmation of the valid grades.",
