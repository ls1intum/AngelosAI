In this meeting I would like to talk about my current study situation and discuss my further options with you. You will find my current examination notice attached. I look forward to your response. Kind regards, <ANONYMIZED>\"",
  "answer" : "Good day, you are welcome to come to one of our open consultation hours without making an appointment in advance to talk about your situation. Unfortunately, individual appointments are not possible. Best regards, <ANONYMIZED>",
