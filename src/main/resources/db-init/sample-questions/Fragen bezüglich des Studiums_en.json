  "question" : "Hello,\n\nI am currently studying a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at TUM and have a few questions:\n\n1. Is it mandatory to choose the application subject at the beginning of the 3rd semester and to take the interdisciplinary basics by the 4th semester? Or are these just suggestions?\n\n2. Do only the language modules listed in the study plan on TUMonline count towards the ECTS? Can I, for example, have Japanese A1 or the English Conversation Partners Program credited towards ECTS?\n\n3. There are some elective modules in the application subject that are listed in the study plan on the website but cannot be found in TUMonline. Which information is correct? Are these modules still offered?\n\n4. Do I have to have passed the necessary prerequisites for the MA3409 module such as IN0018 and knowledge of R before registering? How difficult is the module without prior knowledge?\n\nThank you in advance and have a nice day.\"",
  "answer" : "The choice of the application subject in the 3rd semester and the attendance of the interdisciplinary basics are suggestions.\n\nOnly the language modules listed in the study plan on TUMonline count towards the ECTS. Please note the rules for language modules on our website: https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studierende/ueberfachliche-grundlagen/.\n\nRegarding the elective modules in the application subject, refer to TUMonline, as I have no information on whether these modules are still offered. Please contact the respective chairs for more detailed information.\n\nRegarding MA3409, only the chairs can provide information on whether and how the prior knowledge is required and how difficult the module is without this knowledge.",
