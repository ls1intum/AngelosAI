  "question" : "I failed my re-examinations and would like to know if it makes a difference if I withdraw myself or wait until I am withdrawn due to my final failure. Does this affect my ability to enroll in other subjects?\"",
  "answer" : "It only makes a difference in time whether you exmatriculate yourself now or are exmatriculated by the university at a later date. In both cases, you will be barred from your current course of study at all German universities, while universities of applied sciences are exempt from this rule.",
