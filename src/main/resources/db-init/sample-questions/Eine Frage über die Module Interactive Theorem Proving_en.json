  "question" : "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am a student in the Master's program in Computer Science and have a question about the Interactive Theorem Proving module, which is listed in the module handbook under the interdisciplinary basics. However, it is shown on TUMOnline and the Moodle page as a Bachelor seminar with the module number IN0014. Can I take this module as a Master's student and receive the credits as interdisciplinary basics? It has been discussed in forums that the module number could be incorrect. However, I have not yet received an official answer to this.\n\nBest regards\"",
  "answer" : "If the subject is assigned to your curriculum under the interdisciplinary basics, then you can also include it in this area. Kind regards",
