  "question" : "I started my computer science master's degree this semester and am currently preparing my application for recognition of modules from my bachelor's degree that I have already passed. I would like to know whether I can have an additional module recognized and then use it in the IDP, or whether it has to be taken in parallel with the IDP. If I cannot have the grade recognized, do I have to take the exam again?\"",
  "answer" : "The module you want to use for the IDP does not have to be recognized. Discuss the IDP with your supervisor and if everything is OK, you can specify this module. The grade will then be noted accordingly.",
  "study_program" : "master-informatik"
