I would like to submit a medical certificate and am concerned about possible consequences, especially regarding my credit scores and the threat of expulsion. Could you give me information on how to submit the certificate?\"",
  "answer" : "You do not need to submit a medical certificate to withdraw from exams, as the number of exam attempts is no longer limited. For more information, see 'Withdrawing from exams/withdrawal for health reasons'. It is best to come to one of our open consultation hours to discuss your situation and options.",
