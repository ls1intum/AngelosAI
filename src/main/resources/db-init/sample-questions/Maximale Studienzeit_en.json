  "question" : "I am studying business informatics in my 5th semester and wanted to ask if the semesters count if I only take two exams in the next semester, since I didn't get anything for the internship and seminars. I am planning to do a semester abroad in my 7th or 8th semester. Could the missing places affect my maximum study time of 8 semesters?\"",
  "answer" : "Every semester in which you are not on leave counts as a semester. Therefore, the next semester will also count, even if you only take two modules. You have up to 9 semesters to complete your bachelor's degree if you comply with the study progress control. You can find more information on our website.",
